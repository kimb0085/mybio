I am adept at managing highly impactful projects while consistently showing a strong passion for understanding and solving true business needs. I possess a collaborative style and enjoy working with effective teams to implement projects on time and within budget.</p>

	<p>In addition to my full-time career as a Senior Project Manager at UnitedHealthcare, I pursue academic and philanthropic opportunties.
